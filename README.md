TO DO:

- This article contains a full tutorial:
	- https://towardsdatascience.com/econometric-approach-to-time-series-analysis-seasonal-arima-in-python-28f5782ee23

- Work on my understanding of ARIMA models, their components, and how to tune them:
	- https://www.kaggle.com/sumi25/understand-arima-and-tune-p-d-q
	- https://otexts.com/fpp2/seasonal-arima.html
- Pull more years of data from NOAA and check for missing values
	- https://towardsdatascience.com/getting-weather-data-in-3-easy-steps-8dc10cc5c859
- Split into test and train sets instead of training on the whole set and testing on a subset
